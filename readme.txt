 <h5>Game rules and features:</h5>
        <p>1. The most important rule, if you and your opponent(or computer) guess the same number, then batting side player will considered as OUT.</p>
        <p>2. Here user board and computer board will display the number guessed by user and computer respectively. </p>
        <p>3. While selecting runs, select a number within the range of 1 to 6 only.</p>
        <p>4. You can select desired number of overs as you want to play.</p>
        <p>5. Here numbers are randomly generated, no prefixed patterns are followed. </p>
        <p>6. While selecting keys I have added some shortcut keys like, click R or r to restart the game, B or b for bating and G or g for balling.</p>
     

Upcoming features in future:
1. Currently the game is working on player vs computer method, my target is to transfer
 game on  player vs player, so two player from different location
 can play together.
