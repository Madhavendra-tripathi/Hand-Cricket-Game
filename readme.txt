 <h5>Game Rules:</h5>
        <p>1. The most important rule,if you and your opponent(or computer) guess the same number, then batting side player(or computer) will considered as OUT.</p>
        <p>2. While selecting runs, select a number within the range of 1 to 6 only.</p>
        <p>3. You can select desired number of overs as per your convenience</p>
        <p>4. Here numbers are randomly generated, no prefixed patterns are followed. </p>
        <p>5. While selecting keys I have added some shortcut keys like, click R or r to restart the game, B or b for bating and G or g for balling choosing while toss.</p>
    

Features can be added in future:
1. Currently the game is working on player vs computer method, my target is to transfer
 game on web browser and want to conduct in between two player from different location
can play.
